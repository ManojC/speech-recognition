    public sampleText = `The Universe is everything we can touch, feel, sense, measure or detect. It includes living things, planets, stars, galaxies, dust clouds, light, and even time. Before the birth of the Universe, time, space and matter did not exist. The Universe contains billions of galaxies, each containing millions or billions of stars. The space between the stars and galaxies is largely empty. However, even places far from stars and planets contain scattered particles of dust or a few hydrogen atoms per cubic centimeter. Space is also filled with radiation, magnetic fields and high energy particles. The Universe is incredibly huge. It would take a modern jet fighter more than a million years to reach the nearest star to the Sun. No one knows the exact size of the Universe, because we cannot  see the edge if there is one. All we do know is that the visible Universe is at least 93 billion  light years across.`;
